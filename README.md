# Blockchain-Cryptocurrency-Prediction-System-in-Django
Blockchain Cryptocurrency Prediction System in Django.
- This full-stack website was created on Django and Django REST framework, with SQLite as its database. 
- This website functions as a server, like Discord, where blockchain communities can interact and trade cryptocurrencies. The name of this website is ChainBuds, where blockchain buddies interact without any difficulties.
- ChainBuds is a web app integrated with machine learning where 20 models for 20 cryptocurrencies were trained and tested to provide the users accurate predictions for the opening and closing crypto prices based on 5-year data that was fed to this model.
- A separate panel is created where users can select the respective coin they want to know the price for, and then they must select the "predict" button to get the future prediction prices for that coin. This allows the user to get a broader view of what they are getting into before they participate in any trade-offs. At the same time, they can join any community or create any community where thousands of users will be interacting with each other. 
- ChainBuds include a Django authentication system where request is only granted to authorized users who already are a member of this server, or they register themselves as a member.
